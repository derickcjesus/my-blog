          You guys know how much I love mixing high and low-end – it’s the best
          way to get the most bang for your buck while still elevating your
          wardrobe. The same goes for handbags! And honestly they are probably
          the best pieces to mix and match. I truly think the key to completing
          a look is with a great bag and I found so many this year that I wanted
          to share a round-up of my most worn handbags.
